    "content": "Built in 1914, the Kaohsiung Harbor Museum was initially constructed for the second phase of the Takao Port development during Japanese rule. It served as the Kaohsiung Port Tax Office and was renamed the 'Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau' in 1943, managing all administrative matters related to the port. In 1997, it was renovated into the Harbor Museum, dedicated to preserving and showcasing the history of Kaohsiung Port."

    "content": "The Harbor Museum, a two-story Baroque-style building, is often called the 'Red House' due to its red brick exterior. Notable features include its red and white striped walls, arched doorways, and white decorative bands. The building's design is asymmetrical, with mismatched front walls and varied window styles. Each of the four walls, the interior decorations, and even the perforations in the high ceiling are unique, creating an overall harmony and aesthetic that exudes a unique, irregular charm."
