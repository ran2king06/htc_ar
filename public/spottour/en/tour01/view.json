    "content": "Meet the The Steel Hero of Kaohsiung Harbor â€“ Shou Shan Ferry, the oldest steel champion. Launched in 1996, it was the harbor's first double-decker ferry, serving for decades before retiring in 2019. Back when the Cross-Harbor Tunnel was restricted, it was a lifeline on the Qianzhen-Zhongzhou route, carrying essential goods, gas, and chemicals. It even paved the way for Kaohsiung's steel-hulled ferry fleet, becoming the model for the Cijin Ferry. It was almost scrapped, but Pier-2 Art Center stepped in, turning this emotional connection into a living memory for Kaohsiung's residents, hoping to create new memories for the future."
